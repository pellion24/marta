# marta_project

Personal project for real time MARTA train updates, as well as route-planning

Currently the features allow for location tracking to determine which MARTA station you are at (this can be changed). Then you input
direction and it will tell you when your train is arriving at your station.

My goal is to have route planning enabled, telling you where to transfer, as well as how much time the train ride will take, compared to a 
car ride (Google Maps API). I also hope to make a UI for this rather than just the console.

Currently I'm using the MARTA API, as well as geopy and geocoder libraries on python
